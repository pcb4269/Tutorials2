  <h2>Quantum mechanics</h2>  
  <strong>Quantum mechanics</strong> is a fundamental theory in physics that provides a description of the physical properties of nature at the scale of atoms and subatomic particles. It is the foundation of all quantum physics including <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chemistry" target="_blank" title="Wikipedia">quantum chemistry</a></i>, <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory">quantum field theory</a></i>, <i>quantum technology</i>, and <i>quantum information science</i>.
  <p>Classical physics, the description of physics that existed before the theory of relativity and quantum mechanics, describes many aspects of nature at an ordinary (macroscopic) scale, while quantum mechanics explains the aspects of nature at small (atomic and subatomic) scales, for which classical mechanics is insufficient. Most theories in classical physics can be derived from quantum mechanics as an approximation valid at large (macroscopic) scale.</p>

  <p>Quantum mechanics differs from classical physics in that energy, momentum, angular momentum, and other quantities of a bound system are restricted to discrete values (quantization), objects have characteristics of both particles and waves (wave-particle duality), and there are limits to how accurately the value of a physical quantity can be predicted prior to its measurement, given a complete set of initial conditions (the uncertainty principle).</p>
