  <h2>Statistical mechanics</h2>
  <strong>Statistical mechanics</strong>, one of the pillars of modern physics, describes how macroscopic observations (such as temperature and pressure) are related to microscopic parameters that fluctuate around an average. It connects thermodynamic quantities (such as heat capacity) to microscopic behavior, whereas, in classical thermodynamics, the only available option would be to measure and tabulate such quantities for various materials.
